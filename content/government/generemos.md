## History

The Générémós was created alongside the Liran Republic, and has lasted ever since. 

## Election Procedures

Each Généjé serves a three year term, and is limited to four terms in total. 
Because of how elections are structured, every seat technically goes up for election every three years.
                
Instead of voting for individual candidates at a lower level, each state is 
alotted a certain amount of seats in direct proportion to its population.
                
To determine the threshold for obtaining a seat, the national population is 
divided by the 144, the total number of seats. From there, the population of 
each state is divided by this number, which is rounded to the thousands place. 
Every state is guaranteed the integer value of the result of this operation. 
If there are unfilled slots remaining, the state with the highest remainder is 
given an extra seat first. This continues until every seat has been alotted.
                
Using the 3660 election as an example, 4 seats remained after each state had 
been given their baseline amount of seats. From there, State 7 theoretically had
9.891, so they were the first state to get an "extra" seat. After that, State 3 
had 18.668 seats, meaning they got the next extra seat.
