title: "Proto Daimarian"

Proto-Daimarian is the ancestor of the languages found on the Daimarian peninsula. 
Its most notable descendent is, obviously, Liró, but it gave rise to many others as well.

## Phonology

The most difficult part of the phonology for English speakers to learn would be the ejective series, or the glottal stop, as neither are phonemic in English.
In the case of the glottal stop, it is already found in many speakers, such as between two vowels in a sentence, or in words like "uh-oh".
The ejective series is significantly rarer in English, as it typically only occurs in some speakers between words, where the first word ends in a plosive, and the second begins with a vowel.

|:-------------------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:------:|
|       Plosive       | pʼ pʰ b |  tʼ tʰ d | kʼ kʰ g |   (ʔ)  |

|        Nasal        |    m    |     n    |    ŋ    |        |

| Lateral Approximant |         |     l    |         |        |

## Phonotactics

Proto-Daimarian is fully C{{< sub "1" >}}V(C{{< sub "2" >}}). 
C{{< sub "1" >}} can be any consonant, including the "null" consonant -- the glottal stop. 
C{{< sub "2" >}} cannot be an ejective or glottal stop.

## Orthography

The orthography of Proto-Daimarian is fully phonetic, and almost all consonants are represented by their latin equivalent.
The only exceptions are the voiced velar fricative, /ɣ/, and the velar nasal, /ŋ/, which are represented by ⟨gh⟩ and ⟨ng⟩, respectively. 
The glottal stop may be written with ⟨'⟩, or it may not be written at all, as it is not technically a phoneme. 

## Grammar

On some level, the grammar of Proto-Daimarian is similar to English, but for the most part it is quite different.
Its basic word order is SVO, and it is almost exclusively head initial, with all modifiers except demonstratives going after the head. 
In stark contrast to English, Liran is highly inflected, being mostly agglutinative.

### Nouns

The case system of Proto-Daimarian is, somewhat counterintuitively, significantly simpler than many of its descendents, having only 5 cases and 2 grammatical numbers.
Roots are split into open and closed forms, and are purely agglutinative. 
If a root is -C, it takes the closed form.
If the root is -V, it takes the open form.
The plural suffix does not necessarily have to match the case suffix.

|      Open      | Singular | Plural |
|:--------------:|:--------:|:------:|
| **Nominative** |    -∅    |   -n   |
| **Accusative** |    -me   |  -men  |
|   **Dative**   |    -fi   |  -fin  |
|  **Genitive**  |    -du   |  -dun  |
|  **Locative**  |    -gi   |  -gin  |

|     Closed     | Singular | Plural |
|:--------------:|:--------:|:------:|
| **Nominative** |    -∅    |   -a   |
| **Accusative** |    -e    |   -en  |
|   **Dative**   |    -iw   |  -iwa  |
|  **Genitive**  |    -ol   |  -ola  |
|  **Locative**  |    -ej   |  -eja  |

### Verbs

Similarly to the noun case system, roots are divided into open and closed forms, and affixes follow the same rules. 
The verb system is somewhat fusional, with the tense-aspect and person-number markers being merged. 
All verbs follow the following pattern: 
{{< pre "Prefix(es) + Root + Suffix(es) + [Tense + Aspect] + [Person + Number] " >}}
