title: "Liran"

Liran is one of the most widely spoken languages on the planet Oimosa.
Its English name comes from the Liran word ⟨Liré⟩, meaning "liran". 

## History

Liran is descended from Proto-Daimarian, spoken approximately 6,000 ago. 
The evolution of Modern Liran is as follows:

Proto-Daimarian
- Eastern Daimarian
  - Peninsular Eastern Daimarian
    - Eastern Peninsular Eastern Daimarian
      - Old Liran
        - Middle Liran
          - Modern Liran

## Phonology

The phonology of Modern Liran is fairly easy for speakers of many languages. 
Some areas of trouble include the postalveolar fricatives, /ʃ/ and /ʒ/, the alveolar tap, /ɾ/, and, likely most of all, the distinction between open-mid and close-mid vowels. 

### Consonants

|                 | Labial | Alveolar | Dorsal |
|:---------------:|:------:|:--------:|:------:|
|   **Plosive**   |   p b  |    t d   |   k g  |
|  **Fricative**  |   f v  |    s z   |   ʃ ʒ  |
|    **Nasal**    |    m   |     n    |        |
| **Approximant** |    w   |    ɾ l   |    j   |

### Vowels

|               | Front | Central | Back |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:-------:|:----:|
|   **Close**   |   i   |         |   u  |
| **Close-mid** |   e   |         |   o  |
|    **Mid**    |       |    ə    |      |
|  **Open-Mid** |   ɛ   |         |   ɔ  |
|    **Open**   |       |    ä    |      |

### Diphthongs

|             | e-initial | o-initial | a-initial |
|:-----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| **i-final** |     ei    |     oi    |     ai    |
| **u-final** |     eu    |     ou    |     au    |

### Phonotactics

Modern Liran is (C)V(C).
C{{< sub "1" >}} can only be absent word-initially. Otherwise, it is required, and can be any consonant. 
C{{< sub "2" >}} is often absent, and, if it _is_ present, is almost always a nasal, fricative, /r/, or /l/.
If V is a diphthong, C{{< sub "2" >}} is typically absent, but there are many instances of it being present as well. 

### Stress

Stress in Liran is fairly simple, always falling on the initial syllable of the root. 
For roots three syllables in length, stress also falls finally.
For roots four syllables or longer, stress also falls penultimately.
This very regular stress often leads to an "up and down" sound to the language, as very few words are longer than four syllables, and stressed syllables are typically slightly higher pitched than unstressed syllables.

## Orthography

Modern Liran has a fully phonetic romanization. 
Most sounds are represented with their latin equivalent, but exceptions are listed below.
Only the acute is used, and is always necessary except in diphthongs.
For best practice, however, it should always be used despite the lack of distinction.

|  IPA | Romanization |
|:----:|:------------:|
| ʃ, ʒ |     x, j     |
|   j  |       y      |
|   ɾ  |       r      |
| e, o |     é, ó     |
| ɛ, ɔ |     e, e     |
|   ə  |       a      |
