title: "Liran"

Liran is one of the most widely spoken languages on the planet Neosaia.
Its English name comes from the Liran word ⟨Liré⟩, meaning "liran". 

## History

Liran is descended from Proto-Daimarian, spoken approximately 6,000 ago. 
The evolution of Modern Liran is as follows:

Proto-Daimarian
- Eastern Daimarian
  - Peninsular Eastern Daimarian
    - Eastern Peninsular Eastern Daimarian
      - Old Liró
        - Middle Liró
          - Modern Liró

## Phonology

The phonology of Modern Liran is fairly easy for speakers of many languages. 
Some areas of trouble include the postalveolar fricatives, /ʃ/ and /ʒ/, the alveolar tap, /ɾ/, and, likely most of all, the distinction between open-mid and close-mid vowels. 

### Consonants

|                 | Labial | Alveolar | Dorsal |
|:---------------:|:------:|:--------:|:------:|
|   **Plosive**   |   p b  |    t d   |   k g  |
|  **Fricative**  |   f v  |    s z   |   ʃ ʒ  |
|    **Nasal**    |    m   |     n    |        |
| **Approximant** |    w   |    ɾ l   |    j   |

### Vowels

|               | Front | Central | Back |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:-------:|:----:|
|   **Close**   |   i   |         |   u  |
| **Close-mid** |   e   |         |   o  |
|    **Mid**    |       |    ə    |      |
|  **Open-Mid** |   ɛ   |         |   ɔ  |
|    **Open**   |       |    ä    |      |

### Diphthongs

|             | e-initial | o-initial | a-initial |
|:-----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| **i-final** |     ei    |     oi    |     ai    |
| **u-final** |     eu    |     ou    |     au    |

### Phonotactics

Modern Liran is (C)V(C).
C{{< sub "1" >}} can only be absent word-initially. Otherwise, it is required, and can be any consonant. 
C{{< sub "2" >}} is often absent, and, if it _is_ present, is almost always a nasal, fricative, /r/, or /l/.
If V is a diphthong, C{{< sub "2" >}} is typically absent, but there are many instances of it being present as well. 

### Stress

Stress in Liran is fairly simple, always falling on the initial syllable of the root. 
For roots three syllables in length, stress also falls finally.
For roots four syllables or longer, stress also falls penultimately.
This very regular stress often leads to an "up and down" sound to the language, as very few words are longer than four syllables, and stressed syllables are typically slightly higher pitched than unstressed syllables.

## Orthography

Modern Liran has a mostly phonetic romanization, with only a few diphthongs straying away.
Letters written with breves may have the breve omitted, as the acute is the only completely required diacritic.
The only instances where the breve is required are in the diphthongs ⟨ăi⟩ and ⟨ău⟩, which are pronounced /e/ and /o/, respectively.
Written without the breves, ⟨ai⟩ and ⟨au⟩, they would be /ei/ and /ou/.
This distinction has led to the development of a new method of writing ⟨ai⟩ and ⟨au⟩ as ⟨ái⟩ and ⟨áu⟩, and omitting the breve from writing entirely.
In addition to this standard, there is also a movement to update the spellings of every word to match its pronunciation, but this has yet to gain enough traction to succeed. 

|  IPA | Romanization |
|:----:|:------------:|
| ʃ, ʒ |     x, j     |
|   j  |       y      |
|   ɾ  |       r      |
| e, o |     é, ó     |
| ɛ, ɔ |     ĕ, ŏ     |
|   ə  |       ă      |
