Because of how elections are structured, every seat technically goes up for election every three years.\nInstead of voting for individual candidates at a lower level, each state is alotted a certain amount of seats in direct proportion to its population.\nTo determine the threshold for obtaining a seat, the national population is divided by the 144, the total number of seats. From there, the population of each state is divided by this number, which is rounded to the thousands place. Every state is guaranteed the integer value of the result of this operation. If there are unfilled slots remaining, the state with the highest remainder is given an extra seat first. This continues until every seat has been alotted.\nUsing the 3660 election as an example, 4 seats remained after each state had been given their baseline amount of seats. From there, State 7 theoretically had 9.891, so they were the first state to get an \u0026ldquo;extra\u0026rdquo; seat.

C1 can only be absent word-initially. Otherwise, it is required, and can be any consonant. C2 is often absent, and, if it is present, is almost always a nasal, fricative, /r/, or /l/. If V is a diphthong, C2 is typically absent, but there are many instances of it being present as well.\nStress\u003e Stress # Stress in Liran is fairly simple, always falling on the initial syllable of the root. For roots three syllables in length, stress also falls finally. For roots four syllables or longer, stress also falls penultimately. This very regular stress often leads to an \u0026ldquo;up and down\u0026rdquo; sound to the language, as very few words are longer than four syllables, and stressed syllables are typically slightly higher pitched than unstressed syllables.\nOrthography\u003e Orthography # Modern Liran has a mostly phonetic romanization, with only a few diphthongs straying away. Letters written with breves may have the breve omitted, as the acute is the only completely required diacritic. The only instances where the breve is required are in the diphthongs ⟨ăi⟩ and ⟨ău⟩, which are pronounced /e/ and /o/, respectively. Written without the breves, ⟨ai⟩ and ⟨au⟩, they would be /ei/ and /ou/. This distinction has led to the development of a new method of writing ⟨ai⟩ and ⟨au⟩ as ⟨ái⟩ and ⟨áu⟩, and omitting the breve from writing entirely. In addition to this standard, there is also a movement to update the spellings of every word to match its pronunciation, but this has yet to gain enough traction to succeed.\nIPA Romanization ʃ, ʒ x, j j y ɾ r e, o é, ó ɛ, ɔ ĕ, ŏ ə ă ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/wiki/language/liro/","section":"Language","summary":"Liran is one of the most widely spoken languages on the planet Neosaia.

The glottal stop may be written with ⟨\u0026rsquo;⟩, or it may not be written at all, as it is not technically a phoneme.\nGrammar\u003e Grammar # On some level, the grammar of Proto-Daimarian is similar to English, but for the most part it is quite different. Its basic word order is SVO, and it is almost exclusively head initial, with all modifiers except demonstratives going after the head.\nNouns\u003e Nouns # The case system of Proto-Daimarian is, somewhat counterintuitively, significantly simpler than many of its descendents, having only 5 cases and 2 grammatical numbers. Roots are split into open and closed forms, and are purely agglutinative. If a root is -C, it takes the closed form. If the root is -V, it takes the open form. The plural suffix does not necessarily have to match the case suffix.\nVerbs\u003e Verbs # Similarly to the noun case system, roots are divided into open and closed forms, and affixes follow the same rules. The verb system is somewhat fusional, with the tense-aspect and person-number markers being merged.
